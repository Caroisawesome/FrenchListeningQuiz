# CaroQuizzer

This App is to help English speakers to test their French listening skills. In particular, it quizzes the user on French numbers and dates. This project uses the [VoiceRSS API](http://www.voicerss.org/default.aspx) to access text to speech capabilities. [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com) is used to generate dates.
